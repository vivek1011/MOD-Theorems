Fermat's theorem : 

If a is any integer , then for a prime p : (a ^ p) % p = a 

If a and p are coprime to each other , then comes Euler's theorem ,

 (a ^ etf(p)) % p = 1 
 
Now if there is a exponent a ^ x where x is going outerbound , 
then you need to calculate (a ^ (x % etf(p))) % p because a^etf(p) % p = 1
